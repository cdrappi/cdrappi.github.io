        <h3>Historical context</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Before Constantine (272-337), the citizens of the Roman Empire were pagan, following the ancient
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome">Roman religion</a
          >
          -- basically a knock-off of the ancient

        <li>
          In 313, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan">declared</a> that it was okay to be a Christian. He was warming up to Christianity himself
        </li>
        <li>
            In 325, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">gathered up</a> a bunch of Christian bishops and they defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed">what it meant</a> to believe in Christianity
        </li>
        <li>
            Although he proclaimed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Religious_policy">to believe</a> in Christianity as a forty-something, Constantine waited until his death in 337 to be baptized. He thought that if he waited, God would forgive all of the sins he'd commit during his reign. Genius
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_I">Pope Sylvester I</a> (?-335) became Pope in 314 until his death
        </li>
        <li>
            As the church got more extreme, they decided it wasn't okay that Constantine was baptized on his deathbed. So, the church <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Donation_of_Constantine">made up a legend</a>:

                Constantine wanted to pick up a 2nd wife. Sylvester wasn't okay with this, and the emperor said fuck off. Sylvester ran away into the woods. Then -- KARMA -- Constantine becomes a leper! Pope Sylvester cures him of leprosy, and soon after he was baptized and becomes a Christian.
