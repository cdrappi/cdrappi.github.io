        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <div style="width:650px">
            In the 8th century, the Catholic Church forged a document called the Donation of Constantine. In it, the Roman emperor Constantine gives power over Rome to the Catholic church. An Italian priest named Lorenzo Valla read the document and proved it was
            false by analyzing its language and appealing to common sense

        <h3>CONDENSED SUMMARY</h3>
        <div style="width:650px">
            <p>
                CONSTANTINE THE GREAT (272-337) was the first christian emperor. generations after his death, the roman empire fell and the church gained influence and territory. around 760, after they had enough power to do so, the church forged a document known as
                the <i>Donation of Constantine</i>. in it, the emperor signs away control of the western roman empire to the church because the pope cured him of leprosy that he caught out of karma for wanting two wives.
            </p>
            <p>
                in 1440, an italian priest named LORENZO VALLA was working under the king of sicily. this king was involved in a power dispute with the church. he had lorenzo analyze the donation and lorenzo proved that it was fake. in fact he found this to be obvious,
                and wrote a doctrine on why. his arguments were:
                <ul style="width:550px">
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">logical</div>: constantine wouldn't do this nor did he have the power to. plus if he did, the roman military would have murdered all of the priests since they didn't like christianity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">moral</div>: the bible preaches doing good things for no rewards. a good pope wouldn't have accepted half of an empire for curing leprosy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">medical</div>: you don't become a leper overnight. facts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">linguistic</div>: the document's latin was so shitty, there's no way it was written by an emperor. it muddled past/present tenses and used specific words that no one used at the time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">anachronism</div>: the document was dated in 315, but references constantinople which was still named byzantium at the time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">contextual</div>: the document was written on a piece of paper rather than a bronze plate or something more permanent. what kinda guy would sign away rome on a napkin?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                valla's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Valla#On_the_Donation_of_Constantine">wikipedia page</a> only goes into the logical argument but the other points were just as important

        <h3>HISTORICAL CONTEXT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Before Constantine (272-337), the citizens of the Roman Empire were pagan, following the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome">Roman religion</a
          >
          - basically a knock-off of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion"
            >Greek religion.</a
          > (Zeus => Jupiter, Poseidon => Neptune, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          In 313, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan">declared</a> that it was okay to be a Christian. He was warming up to Christianity himself
            </li>
            <li>
                In 325, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">gathered up</a> a bunch of Christian bishops and they defined what it meant to believe in Christianity. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed">Nicene Creed</a>                and it is still hip today
            </li>
            <li>
                Although he proclaimed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Religious_policy">to believe</a> in Christianity in his 40s, Constantine waited to be baptized on his deathbed. He thought that if he waited, God would
                forgive the sins he'd inevitably commit during the rest of his reign. Genius
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_I">Pope Sylvester I</a> (?-335) was Pope from 314 until his death, so he overlapped the most with Constantine
            </li>
            <li>
                As the church got more extreme, they decided it wasn't okay that Constantine was baptized on his deathbed. So, the church <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Donation_of_Constantine">made up a legend</a>:
                <p>
                    <div style="color:white">&lt;fiction&gt;</div>
                    Constantine wanted to pick up a 2nd wife. Sylvester wasn't okay with this, and the emperor said fuck off. Sylvester ran away into the woods. Then -- KARMA -- Constantine becomes a leper! Pope Sylvester cures him of leprosy, and soon after he was baptized
                    and becomes a Christian.
                    <div style="color:white">&lt;\fiction&gt;</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                ==> FAST FORWARD ==> A roman emperor from 996-1002, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Otto III</a>, was one of the first people to dispute the <i>Donation</i>'s legitimacy on record. He churned out a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospels_of_Otto_III">Gospel</a> that raised suspicions of the document. I couldn't find his gospel online and I am a level 9 googler.
            </li>
            <li>
                ==> FAST-FORWARD AGAIN ==> to 1439. The king of Sicily, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_V_of_Aragon">Alfonso</a> has long tried to conquer Naples, Italy from the church. He does this largely through bloody war, but has one
                of his priests, Lorenzo Valla, do work of a more intellectual nature. Valla checks out the <i>Donation of Constantine</i> and the rest is history, which I will continue to summarize for you in <a href="http://www.schoolbytes.com/">schoolbytes</a>-like

        <h3>THE DOCUMENT ITSELF</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                About four pages long
            </li>
            <li>
                Dated March 30, either 315 or 317
            </li>
            <li>
                "Constantine" starts by mentioning the Blessed Acts of Sylvester (leprosy)
            </li>
            <li>
                He says now, the Pope is in charge of the Western Roman Empire
            </li>
            <li>
                You should hold priests & bishops in the same regard as senators & the military
            </li>
            <li>
                It is not correct for an "earthly emperor" to have jurisdiction over Rome
            </li>
            <li>
                Best quote: "we entreat [everyone]... to come subject to our rule, that no one of them in any way be allowed to either break these [decrees], or in any way overthrow them". lol

        <h3>VALLA's TREATISE</h3>
        <div style="width:650px">
            <p>
            Valla makes a ton of good points that would convince anyone of the document's forgery. But rather than dismantling the document one step at a time, he jumps between arguments. He'll build up this appeal to Christian morality, and then all of a sudden talk about leprosy or cite an anarchonism. It's all over the place. Our summary will break out Valla's writing into chunks but drop its chronological order
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we get going: note that Valla knew that he was playing with fire by writing this... "Unless, perhaps we think the supreme pontiff would bear these attacks more patiently than would others." LMAO
