            <p>
                constantine (272-337) was the first christian emperor. as the roman empire fell, the church gained influence and territory. around 760, after they had enough power to do so, they forged a document known as the <i>Donation of Constantine</i>,
                where the emperor signs away full control of the western roman empire to the church because the pope cured him of leprosy
            </p>
            <p>
                in 1440, an italian priest named LORENZO VALLA analyzed the donation and proved that it was fake. his arguments were:
                <ul style="width:550px">
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">logic</div>: there's no way constantine would do this or rome would let him do this. if he did, the romans would have murdered all of the priests since most people weren't on board with christianity yet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">linguistic</div>: the document's latin was so shitty, there's no way it was written by an emperor. also, it used words that romans wouldn't have used at the time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">medical</div>: you don't become a leper overnight
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">moral</div>: the bible preaches doing good things for no rewards. a good pope wouldn't have accepted half of an empire for curing leprocy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">contextual</div>: the document was written on a piece of paper rather than a bronze plate or something more permanent. who would sign away the western roman empire on a napkin?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                valla's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Valla#On_the_Donation_of_Constantine">wikipedia page</a> only goes into the logical argument and briefly mentions the anachronism but to me the other points are just as convincing

        <h3>HISTORICAL CONTEXT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Before Constantine (272-337), the citizens of the Roman Empire were pagan, following the ancient
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome">Roman religion</a
          >
          -- basically a knock-off of the ancient
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion"
            >Greek religion.</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          In 313, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan">declared</a> that it was okay to be a Christian. He was warming up to Christianity himself
            </li>
            <li>
                In 325, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">gathered up</a> a bunch of Christian bishops and they defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed">what it meant</a> to believe in Christianity
            </li>
            <li>
                Although he proclaimed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Religious_policy">to believe</a> in Christianity as a forty-something, Constantine waited until his death in 337 to be baptized. He thought that if he
                waited, God would forgive all of the sins he'd commit during his reign. Genius
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_I">Pope Sylvester I</a> (?-335) became Pope in 314 until his death
            </li>
            <li>
                As the church got more extreme, they decided it wasn't okay that Constantine was baptized on his deathbed. So, the church <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Donation_of_Constantine">made up a legend</a>:
                <p>
                    <div style="color:white">&lt;fiction&gt;</div>
                    Constantine wanted to pick up a 2nd wife. Sylvester wasn't okay with this, and the emperor said fuck off. Sylvester ran away into the woods. Then -- KARMA -- Constantine becomes a leper! Pope Sylvester cures him of leprosy, and soon after he was baptized
                    and becomes a Christian.
                    <div style="color:white">&lt;\fiction&gt;</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div title="Donation of Constantine" style="padding-top:10px;">
        <h3>THE DOCUMENT ITSELF</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
