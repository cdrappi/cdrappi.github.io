        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <div style="width:650px">
            <p>
                CONSTANTINE THE GREAT (272-337) was the first christian emperor. long after his death, the roman empire fell and the church gained influence and territory. around 760, after they had enough power to do so, the church forged a document known as the <i>Donation of Constantine</i>.
                in it, the emperor signs away control of the western roman empire to the church because the pope cured him of leprosy that he caught out of karma for wanting two wives.

                in 1440, an italian priest named LORENZO VALLA was working under the king of sicily. this king was involved in a power dispute with the church. the king had lorenzo analyze the donation and lorenzo proved that it was fake. in fact he found this to be
                obvious, and wrote a doctrine on why. his arguments were:
                <ul style="width:550px">
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">logic</div>: there's no way constantine would do this or rome would let him do it. if he did, the roman military would have murdered all of the priests since most romans weren't on board with christianity yet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">linguistic</div>: the document's latin was so shitty, there's no way it was written by an emperor. also, it used words that romans wouldn't have used at the time (anachronism)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">medical</div>: you don't become a leper overnight. facts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">moral</div>: the bible preaches doing good things for no rewards. a good pope wouldn't have accepted half of an empire for curing leprosy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">contextual</div>: the document was written on a piece of paper rather than a bronze plate or something more permanent. what kinda guy would sign away rome on a napkin?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                valla's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Valla#On_the_Donation_of_Constantine">wikipedia page</a> only goes into the logical argument and briefly mentions the anachronism but to me the other points are just as convincing

        <h3>HISTORICAL CONTEXT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Before Constantine (272-337), the citizens of the Roman Empire were pagan, following the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome">Roman religion</a
          >
          - basically a knock-off of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion"
            >Greek religion.</a
          > (Zeus => Jupiter, Poseidon => Neptune, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          In 313, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan">declared</a> that it was okay to be a Christian. He was warming up to Christianity himself
            </li>
            <li>
                In 325, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">gathered up</a> a bunch of Christian bishops and they defined what it meant to believe in Christianity. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed">Nicene Creed</a>                and it is still hip today
            </li>
            <li>
                Although he proclaimed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Religious_policy">to believe</a> in Christianity in his 40s, Constantine waited to be baptized on his deathbed. He thought that if he waited, God would
                forgive the sins he'd inevitably commit during the rest of his reign. Genius
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_I">Pope Sylvester I</a> (?-335) was Pope from 314 until his death, so he overlapped the most with Constantine
            </li>
            <li>
                As the church got more extreme, they decided it wasn't okay that Constantine was baptized on his deathbed. So, the church <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Donation_of_Constantine">made up a legend</a>:
                <p>
                    <div style="color:white">&lt;fiction&gt;</div>
                    Constantine wanted to pick up a 2nd wife. Sylvester wasn't okay with this, and the emperor said fuck off. Sylvester ran away into the woods. Then -- KARMA -- Constantine becomes a leper! Pope Sylvester cures him of leprosy, and soon after he was baptized
                    and becomes a Christian.
                    <div style="color:white">&lt;\fiction&gt;</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                ==> FAST FORWARD ==> A roman emperor from 996-1002, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Otto III</a>, was one of the first people to dispute the <i>Donation</i>'s legitimacy on record. He churned out a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospels_of_Otto_III">Gospel</a> that raised suspicions of the document. I couldn't find his gospel online and I am a level 9 googler.
            </li>
            <li>
                ==> FAST-FORWARD AGAIN ==> to 1439. The king of Sicily, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_V_of_Aragon">Alfonso</a> has long tried to conquer Naples, Italy from the church. He does this largely through bloody war, but has one
                of his priests, Lorenzo Valla, do work of a more intellectual nature. Valla checks out the <i>Donation of Constantine</i> and the rest is history, which I will continue to summarize for you in <a href="http://www.schoolbytes.com/">schoolbytes</a>-like

        <ul>
            <li>
                "Constantine" starts by mentioning the Blessed Acts of Sylvester (leprosy)
            </li>
            <li>
                He says now, the Pope is in charge of the Western Roman Empire
            </li>
            <li>
                You should hold priests & bishops in the same regard as senators & the military
            </li>
            <li>
                It is not correct for an "earthly emperor" to have jurisdiction over Rome
            </li>
            <li>
                Best quote: "we entreat [everyone]... to come subject to our rule, that no one of them in any way be allowed to either break these [decrees], or in any way overthrow them". lol
