        <h3>TLDR</h3>
        <div style="width:650px">
            In the 8th century, the Catholic Church forged a document called the <i>Donation of Constantine</i>. In it, the Roman emperor Constantine "donates" ruling power to the church. Centuries later, an Italian priest named Lorenzo Valla read the
            document and proved it was false using a bunch of very solid arguments

        <h3>LONGER TLDR</h3>
        <div style="width:650px">
            <p>
                CONSTANTINE THE GREAT (272-337) was the first Christian emperor. Generations after his death, the Roman empire fell and the church gained influence & territory. Around 760, after they had enough power to pull it off, the church forged a document known
                as the <i>Donation of Constantine</i>. In it, the emperor signs away control of the Western Roman Empire to the church. Apparantly he was very grateful to the pope, who cured him of leprosy, and this was his way to say
                "thanks"
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1439, an Italian priest and humanist named LORENZO VALLA was working under the king of Sicily. This king was involved in a power dispute with the church. He had Lorenzo analyze the <i>Donation</i> and Lorenzo proved that it was fake.
                In fact he found this to be obvious, and wrote a doctrine on why. His arguments were:

        <h3>HISTORICAL CONTEXT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Before Constantine (272-337), the citizens of the Roman Empire were pagan, following the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome">Roman religion</a
          >
          - basically a knock-off of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion"
            >Greek religion.</a
          > (Zeus => Jupiter, Poseidon => Neptune, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          In 313, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan">declared</a> that it was okay to be a Christian. He was warming up to Christianity himself
            </li>
            <li>
                In 325, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">gathered up</a> a bunch of Christian bishops and they defined what it meant to believe in Christianity. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed">Nicene Creed</a>                and it is still a thing today
            </li>
            <li>
                Although he proclaimed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Religious_policy">to believe</a> in Christianity in his 40s, Constantine waited to be baptized on his deathbed. He thought that if he waited, God would
                forgive the sins he'd inevitably commit during the rest of his reign. Genius
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_I">Pope Sylvester I</a> (?-335) was Pope from 314 until his death, so he overlapped the most with Constantine
            </li>
            <li>
                As the church got more extreme, they decided it wasn't okay that Constantine was baptized on his deathbed. So, the church <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Donation_of_Constantine">made up a legend</a>:
                <p>
                    <div style="color:white">&lt;fiction&gt;</div>
                    Constantine wanted to pick up a 2nd wife. Pope Sylvester wasn't happy about this, and the emperor said I don't care what you think, fuck off. Sylvester ran away into the woods. Then Constantine becomes a leper! Sylvester comes back from the woods and
                    cures him of leprosy. Soon after, Constantine was baptized into Christianity.
                    <div style="color:white">&lt;\fiction&gt;</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                ==> FAST FORWARD ==> A roman emperor from 996-1002, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Otto III</a>, was one of the first people to dispute the <i>Donation</i>'s legitimacy on record. He churned out a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospels_of_Otto_III">Gospel</a> that raised suspicions of the document. I couldn't find his gospel online and I am a level 9 googler.
            </li>
            <li>
                ==> FAST-FORWARD AGAIN ==> to 1439. The king of Sicily, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_V_of_Aragon">Alfonso</a> had long tried to usurp Naples from the church. He did this largely through bloody war, but also had one of
                his priests hit the books. Lorenzo Valla checked out the <i>Donation of Constantine</i> and the rest is history, which I will continue to summarize for you in <a href="http://www.schoolbytes.com/">schoolbytes</a>-like form
            </li>
            <li>
                The printing press was invented around the same year, c. 1440. I assume Valla was not first in line. So it took decades for his work to be spread
            </li>
            <li>
                In 1559, he church placed Valla's critique on their index of prohibited works
            </li>
            <li>
                From 1588-1607, an Italian cardinal named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_Baronius">Caesar Baronius</a> wrote a 12 volume history of the church called <i>Annales Ecclesiastici</i>. In it, he admits the <i>Donation</i> is
                a forgery. After this, the document was widely accepted to be a forgery
            </li>
            <li>
                Once they realized the jig was up, the church stopped referring to the <i>Donation</i> to establish authority. However the church didn't officially admit the document was a forgery until the 19th century!

        <h3>VALLA'S TREATISE</h3>
        <div style="width:650px">
            <p>
                Valla makes a ton of good points that would convince anyone of the document's forgery. But rather than dismantling the document one step at a time, he jumps between arguments. For example, he'll start talking about how one develops leprosy, and then out
                of nowhere go really deep into Latin grammar. It's all over the place. For this reason our summary will group Valla's main points and ignore the chronological order of his writing
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we get going: note that Valla knew that he was playing with fire by writing this... "Unless, perhaps we think the supreme pontiff would bear these attacks more patiently than would others."

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Constantine spent so much time conquering land and building the Roman empire. Why go through all the trouble just to give it away?
                </li>
                <li>
                    God never told any ruler to give up his government: the only guideline was to protect the Hebrew people
                </li>
                <li>
                    Jewish kings didn't even give up their land
                </li>
                <li>
                    The document was written on a piece of paper rather than a bronze plate. Who would seriously sign away half of Rome on the back of a napkin?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="argument-name">sylvester wouldn't have accepted</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Accepting the Donation would have conflicted with Christian teachings
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Freely ye have received, freely <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-8.htm">give</a>"
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the people planned to make Jesus the king, he fled to the mountains. "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm">fight</a>"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Example: Elisha didn't accept reward for curing leprosy of Naaman the Syrian
                </li>
                <li>
                    If Sylvester did accept, we would have a record of it in writing. After all this is a monumental transfer of power. No such record exists
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="argument-name">a transfer of power would have caused great uproar</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Constantine's sons would not have accepted this quietly. They lived their whole life eager to take over for their father. To find out he gave away their power to the church? They'd be furious
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 313, Constantine made it "okay" to be a Christian. Meaning, most Romans were still not down with Christianity at the time. The people would go bananas to hear that they're now under rule of the church TWO YEARS LATER!
                </li>
                <li>
                    The military, much like the people, were loyal to Rome. If Constantine gave his power to Sylvester, the military would have murdered every single bishop and priest they could find. Why would Constantine do this to Sylvester if he liked him so much?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="argument-name">reference to the city "constantinople"</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The document was dated around 315. It mentions "Constantinople" as one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentarchy">five</a> episcopal sees of the Roman Empire
                </li>
                <li>
                    The term "Constantinople" hadn't yet been created: the city was called Byzantium until 330
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="argument-name">constantine didn't even have leprosy: that legend was made up</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Valla consulted physicians: leprosy isn't something you wake up with all of a sudden. It develops gradually
                </li>
                <li>
                    So the idea that Constantine became a leper overnight because he wanted a 2nd wife is absurd
                </li>
                <li>
                    Even if he did have leprosy, he would've known about it before he was elected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul">consul</a> for the fourth time
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every time a person in power became a leper, they secluded themselves. Constantine did no such thing
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="argument-name">the document was riddled with sloppy latin</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It used the past tense like "we decreed" and "we granted". Valla comments: "as though it were not being done now, but had been done some other time!"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes it would switch tenses, e.g., "we proclaim" vs. "we have proclaimed"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Romans never used the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satrap">"satraps"</a> to refer to their leaders. The document used it multiple times
                </li>
                <li>
                    Often the document confuses two similar Latin words. Here's a beautiful example: "He uses ... '<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concubitor#Latin">concubitores</a>' [translated above, bed-watchers] for '<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contubernalis#Latin">contubernales</a>'
                    [companions or attendents]. 'Concubitores' are literally those who sleep together and have intercourse; they must certainly be understood to be harlots"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Valla makes a subtle argument around the usage of the word "given" (in Latin, either "illi" or "ad illum"). The Donation says it was "given" by Constantine. However in Latin, documents that had no specific recipient could not be "given": this word was
                    restricted for letters delivered by a courier.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div style="width:650px">
            <p>
                <div class="sub-bullet">CONCLUSION</div>: Valla believes that a Pope forged the document after the church had more power than the government. They used this power to further the myth, as they would require emperors to confirm that the document is legit. Valla
                then asks: why do we respect the popes at all if they use all these tricks and ploys?
