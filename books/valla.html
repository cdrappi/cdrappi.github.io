        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <div style="width:650px">
            In the 8th century, the Catholic Church forged a document called the <i>Donation of Constantine</i>. In it, the Roman emperor Constantine gives power over Rome to the Catholic church. An Italian priest named Lorenzo Valla read the document and proved it was
            false by examining its historical context and analyzing its language

        <h3>CONDENSED SUMMARY</h3>
        <div style="width:650px">
            <p>
                CONSTANTINE THE GREAT (272-337) was the first christian emperor. generations after his death, the roman empire fell and the church gained influence & territory. around 760, after they had enough power to do so, the church forged a document known as
                the <i>Donation of Constantine</i>. in it, the emperor signs away control of the western roman empire to the church because the pope cured him of leprosy that he caught out of karma for wanting two wives.
            </p>
            <p>
                in 1440, an italian priest named LORENZO VALLA was working under the king of sicily. this king was involved in a power dispute with the church. he had lorenzo analyze the donation and lorenzo proved that it was fake. in fact he found this to be obvious,
                and wrote a doctrine on why. his arguments were:
                <ul style="width:550px">
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">logic</div>: constantine wouldn't do this nor did he have the power to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">christian morals</div>: the bible preaches doing good things for no rewards. a good pope wouldn't have accepted half of an empire for curing leprosy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">lack of conflict</div>: the roman military would have murdered all of the priests immediately since they didn't like christianity yet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">anachronism</div>: the document was dated in 315, but references constantinople which was still named byzantium at the time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">medical</div>: you don't become a leper overnight. facts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="sub-bullet">language</div>: the document's latin was so shitty, there's no way it was written by an emperor. it muddled past/present tenses and used words that no one used at the time
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                valla's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Valla#On_the_Donation_of_Constantine">wikipedia page</a> only goes into the logical argument but the other points were just as convincing

        <h3>HISTORICAL CONTEXT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Before Constantine (272-337), the citizens of the Roman Empire were pagan, following the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome">Roman religion</a
          >
          - basically a knock-off of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion"
            >Greek religion.</a
          > (Zeus => Jupiter, Poseidon => Neptune, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          In 313, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan">declared</a> that it was okay to be a Christian. He was warming up to Christianity himself
            </li>
            <li>
                In 325, Constantine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">gathered up</a> a bunch of Christian bishops and they defined what it meant to believe in Christianity. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed">Nicene Creed</a>                and it is still hip today
            </li>
            <li>
                Although he proclaimed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Religious_policy">to believe</a> in Christianity in his 40s, Constantine waited to be baptized on his deathbed. He thought that if he waited, God would
                forgive the sins he'd inevitably commit during the rest of his reign. Genius
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sylvester_I">Pope Sylvester I</a> (?-335) was Pope from 314 until his death, so he overlapped the most with Constantine
            </li>
            <li>
                As the church got more extreme, they decided it wasn't okay that Constantine was baptized on his deathbed. So, the church <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great#Donation_of_Constantine">made up a legend</a>:
                <p>
                    <div style="color:white">&lt;fiction&gt;</div>
                    Constantine wanted to pick up a 2nd wife. Sylvester wasn't okay with this, and the emperor said fuck off. Sylvester ran away into the woods. Then Constantine becomes a leper! Pope Sylvester cures him of this leprosy, and soon after he was baptized into Christianity.
                    <div style="color:white">&lt;\fiction&gt;</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                ==> FAST FORWARD ==> A roman emperor from 996-1002, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Otto III</a>, was one of the first people to dispute the <i>Donation</i>'s legitimacy on record. He churned out a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospels_of_Otto_III">Gospel</a> that raised suspicions of the document. I couldn't find his gospel online and I am a level 9 googler.
            </li>
            <li>
                ==> FAST-FORWARD AGAIN ==> to 1439. The king of Sicily, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_V_of_Aragon">Alfonso</a> has long tried to conquer Naples from the church. He does this largely through bloody war, but has one
                of his priests, Lorenzo Valla, do work of a more intellectual nature. Valla checks out the <i>Donation of Constantine</i> and the rest is history, which I will continue to summarize for you in <a href="http://www.schoolbytes.com/">schoolbytes</a>-like

        <h3>THE DOCUMENT ITSELF</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                About four pages long
            </li>
            <li>
                Dated March 30, either 315 or 317
            </li>
            <li>
                "Constantine" starts by mentioning the Blessed Acts of Sylvester (leprosy)
            </li>
            <li>
                He says starting now, the Pope is in charge of the Western Roman Empire
            </li>
            <li>
                Hold priests & bishops in the same regard as senators & the military
            </li>
            <li>
                Rationale: It is not correct for an "earthly emperor" to rule over Rome

                Best quote: "we entreat [everyone]... to come subject to our rule, that no one of them in any way be allowed to either break these [decrees], or in any way overthrow them". lol

        <h3>VALLA's TREATISE</h3>
        <div style="width:650px">
            <p>
            Valla makes a ton of good points that would convince anyone of the document's forgery. But rather than dismantling the document one step at a time, he jumps between arguments. For example, he'll start talking about how one develops leprosy, and then out of nowhere go really deep into Latin grammar. It's all over the place. For this reason our summary will group Valla's main points and drop the chronological order
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we get going: note that Valla knew that he was playing with fire by writing this... "Unless, perhaps we think the supreme pontiff would bear these attacks more patiently than would others." LMAO

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Constantine spent so much time conquering land and building the Roman empire. Why go through all the trouble just to give it away?
                </li>
                <li>
                    God never told any ruler to give up his government: the only guideline was to protect the Hebrew people
                </li>
                <li>
                    Jewish kings didn't even give up their land
                </li>
                <li>
                    The document was written on a piece of paper rather than a bronze plate. Who would seriously sign away half of Rome on the back of a napkin?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="argument-name">sylvester wouldn't have accepted</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "Freely ye have received, freely <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-8.htm">give</a>"
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the people planned to make Jesus the king, he fled to the mountains. "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm">fight</a>"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Example: Elisha didn't accept reward for curing leprosy of Naaman the Syrian
                </li>
                <li>
                    If he did accept, it would have to be in some form of writing. No such record exists
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="argument-name">a transfer of power would have caused great uproar</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Constantine's sons would not have accepted this quietly. They live their whole life eager to take over for their father. To find out he gave away their power to the Pope? They'd be furious
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 313, Constantine made it "okay" to be a Christian. Meaning, most Romans were still not down with Christianity at the time. The people would go bananas to hear that they're now under rule of the church
                </li>
                <li>
                    The military, much like the people, were loyal to Rome. If Constantine gave his power to Sylvester, the military would have murdered every single bishop and priest they could find. Why would Constantine do this to Sylvester if he liked him so much?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="argument-name">reference to the city "constantinople"</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The document was dated around 315. It mentions "Constantinople" as one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentarchy">five</a> episcopal sees of the Roman Empire
                </li>
                <li>
                    The term "Constantinople" hadn't yet been created: the city was called Byzantium until 330
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="argument-name">constantine didn't even have leprosy: that legend was made up</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Valla consulted physicians, and knew leprosy isn't something you wake up with all of a sudden.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Therefore, if he did have leprosy, he would've known about it before he was elected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul">consul</a> for the fourth time
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every time a person in power became a leper, they secluded themselves. Constantine did no such thing
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="argument-name">the document was riddled with sloppy latin</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It used the past tense like "we decreed" and "we granted". Valla comments: "as though it were not being done now, but had been done some other time!"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes it would switches tenses, e.g., "we proclaim" vs. "we have proclaimed"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Romans never used the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satrap">"satraps"</a> to refer to their leaders. This document used it multiple times
                </li>
                <li>
                    Often the document confused two similar Latin words. Here's a beautiful example: "He uses ... '<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concubitor#Latin">concubitores</a>' [translated above, bed-watchers] for '<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contubernalis#Latin">contubernales</a>' [companions or attendents]. 'Concubitores' are literally those who sleep together and have intercourse; they must certainly be understood to be harlots"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Valla makes a subtle argument around the usage of the word "given" (in Latin, either "illi" or "ad illum"). The Donation says it was "given" by Constantine. However in Latin, documents that had no specific recipient could not be "given": this word was restricted for letters delivered by a courier.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div style="width:650px">
            <p>
                <div class="sub-bullet">CONCLUSION</div>: Valla believes that a Pope forged the document after the church had more power than the government. They used this power to further the myth, requiring emperors to confirm that the document is legit. Valla then asks: why do we respect the popes at all if they use all these tricks and ploys?
